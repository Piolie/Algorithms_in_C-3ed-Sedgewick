Give the running time of Program 3.9, within a constant factor, as a
function of Iv1 and N.

The first (for) loop runs N - 1 times, one for each node that is added
to the list.

The second (while) loop runs N - 1 times. This is evident form the fact
that each iteration deletes one node, and runs until only one node is
left. It has an inner for loop that runs M - 1 times, so as to skip as
many nodes.

Thus,
    T = c0 + c1*N + c2*N*M
