The block guarded by the if takes i and sets all its multiples' entries
to 0 in the array, so as to mark them "not prime". But it only makes
sense to do this if i is known to be prime itself. By removing the
guard, the program does extra work, setting to 0 many entries which
have already been cleared by factors of non-prime i.
