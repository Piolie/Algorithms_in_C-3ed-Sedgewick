                          List insertion sort
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code generates N random integers between 0 and 999, builds a linked
list with one number per node (first for loop), and then rearranges the
nodes so that the numbers appear in order when we traverse the list
(second for loop). To accomplish the sort, we maintain two lists, an
input (unsorted) list and an output (sorted) list. On each iteration of
the loop, we remove a node from the input and insert it into position
in the output. The code is simplified by the use of head nodes for each
list, that contain the links to the first nodes on the lists. For
example, without the head node, the case where the node to be inserted
into the output list goes at the beginning would involve extra code.

  u = t->next;

    if (x->next->item > t->item)
      break;
