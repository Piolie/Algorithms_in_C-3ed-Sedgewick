------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose that you have a set of nodes with no null pointers (each node
points to itself or to some other node in the set). Prove that you
ultimately get into a cycle if you start at any given node and follow
links.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

(It's assumed that the links don't change during traversal.)

Suppose we have N nodes n1, n2, ..., nN (in any order). Then, n1 has to
point to itself or to one of the others. If it points to itself, we are
in a cycle of length 1. Let's suppose it points to another node, say,
n2. Then, if n2 points to n1, we end in a cycle of length 2. If it
doesn't, it has to point to another node, say, n3. n3 can point to n1 or
n2, which results in a cycle of length 3 or 2, or to one of the
others...
If we continue this process further, we end up in the last node, nN,
which can only point to one of the previous ones, thus forming a cycle.

This is just a sketch, not formal proof. I'm not versed in graph theory.
