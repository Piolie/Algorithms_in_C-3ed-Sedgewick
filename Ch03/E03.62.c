Write an efficient program that finds the length of the longest sequence
of blanks in a given string, examining as few characters in the string
as possible. Hint: Your program should become faster as the length of
the sequence of blanks increases.

Ideas brought (stolen?) from [Algorithm to find lenth of longest sequence of blanks in a given string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2616932/).

Suppose the longest sequence found thus far is of length M.
0. If b > s_len - M, no longer sequence can fit in the remaining string,
so we end the search.
1. If we now find a blank at position b, we can go to b+M-1 and check if
that is also a blank.
2. If it is a blank, we have to check backwards from b+M-2 down to b.
    2a. If all chars are blanks, then we found a sequence of at least
    the same length, so we start checking forwards, incrementing M.
    2b. Otherwise, the first non-blank is the new value of b.
3. If it's not blank, then we increment b by M.

The problem with this algorithm is that it misbehaves while M < 2, since
M-1 < 0 and M-2 < 0. Thus, we have a first part that loops until it
finds a sequence of at least 2 blanks.

I'll assume the string is given in argv[1].
