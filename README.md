In this repo I'll be adding my solutions to the exercises in the book **"Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Parts 1-4," by Robert Sedgewick**. I aim to solve every single one, although this is just for fun and may never be finished.

Each chapter has its own folder and for convenience I've also included the original programs from the book ready to be compiled and run.

Feel free to open an issue or file a pull request if you like.
