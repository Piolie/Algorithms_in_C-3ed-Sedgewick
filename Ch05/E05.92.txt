------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show how recursive depth-fâ€Œirst search visits the nodes in the graph
built for the edge sequence 0-2, 1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 0-4, 6-0, and 1-3 (see
Exercise 3.70), by giving diagrams corresponding to Figures 5.33 (left)
and 5.34 (right).

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the letter of the exercise should instead refer to
Figure 5.34 (left). However, I've been unable to decipher its
interpretation.

The graph looks like this:
     -- 0 --
    /   |   \
   /    2    \
  4     |     6
   \    5    /
    \       /
     1 --- 3

The adjacency lists are:
0: 6 -> 4 -> 2
1: 3 -> 4
2: 5 -> 0
3: 1 -> 6
4: 0 -> 1
5: 2
6: 0 -> 3

Figure 5.33 (left):
  0 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 4 - 2 - 5

Figure 5.34 (right): ?
