Compute the average distance from a node to the root in a worst-case
tree of 2^n nodes built by the weighted quick-union algorithm.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

The depth of a node in a tree is the number of links on the path from it
to the root. Thus, we are looking for the average depth.

The book states without proof that the worst case is when the sets to be
merged in the union operation are always equal (and a power of 2).

We will state that the number of nodes at each level in the worst-case
trees built by the weighted quick-union algorithm are binomial
coefficients. (See [CSTE] for a proof of this statement.) That is, for a
worst-case tree with N = 2^n elements, the number of nodes at level i
is:
  /n\       n!
  | | = ----------
  \i/   i!(n - i)!

Now that we know the number of nodes in each level, we can calculate the
average depth. (Each node in level i has depth i.)

              i = n
           1   ---
  Avg_d = ---  \   (level depth) * (number of nodes in that level)
          2^n  /
               ---
              i = 0

              i = n
           1   ---     /n\
        = ---  \   i * | |
          2^n  /       \i/
               ---
              i = 0

           1
        = --- * n * 2^(n - 1) (see [Wiki] for this result)
          2^n

        = n/2
