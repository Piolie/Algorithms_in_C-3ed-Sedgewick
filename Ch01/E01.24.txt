                              EXERCISE 1.24
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give an approximate formula for the number of random edges that is
required to connect N objects, as a function of N.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Let's inspect the output of exercise 1.22:
    N = 10^3 -> 3662
    N = 10^4 -> 48194
    N = 10^5 -> 604954
    N = 10^6 -> 7103127

Could it be linear growth? Let's try NRE = k*N, with k = 3.7:
    N = 10^3 -> 3700
    N = 10^4 -> 37000
    N = 10^5 -> 370000
    N = 10^6 -> 3700000
it seems to track the order of magnitude correctly, but starts to
underestimate the number of edges quickly as N increases.

What about logarithmic growth? Let's try NRE = k*lg N, with k = 370:
    N = 10^3 -> 3687
    N = 10^4 -> 4916
    N = 10^5 -> 6146
    N = 10^6 -> 7375
it seems to track the figures closely, but underestimate the order of
magnitude.

Combining these two aproaches with NRE = 0.375*N*lg(N) yields much
better results:
    N = 10^3 -> 3737    (2.0% off)
    N = 10^4 -> 49829   (3.4% off)
    N = 10^5 -> 622862  (3.0% off)
    N = 10^6 -> 7474338 (5.2% off)

This is called near-linear growth. The value we've got is close to the
theoretical Â½ N lg N.
