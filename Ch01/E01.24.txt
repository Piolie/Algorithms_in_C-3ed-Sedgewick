                              EXERCISE 1.24
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Give an approximate formula for the number of random edges that is
required to connect N objects, as a function of N.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Let's inspect the output of exercise 1.22:
    N = 10^3 -> 3695
    N = 10^4 -> 48764
    N = 10^5 -> 601638
    N = 10^6 -> 7484813

Could it be linear growth? Let's try NRE = k*N, with k = 3.7:
    N = 10^3 -> 3700
    N = 10^4 -> 37000
    N = 10^5 -> 370000
    N = 10^6 -> 3700000
it seems to track the order of magnitude correctly, but starts to
underestimate the number of edges quickly as N increases.

What about logarithmic growth? Let's try NRE = k*lg N, with k = 370:
    N = 10^3 -> 3687
    N = 10^4 -> 4916
    N = 10^5 -> 6146
    N = 10^6 -> 7375
it seems to track the figures closely, but underestimate the order of
magnitude.

Combining these two aproaches with NRE = 0.375*N*lg(N) yields much
better results:
    N = 10^3 -> 3737    (1.1% off)
    N = 10^4 -> 49829   (2.2% off)
    N = 10^5 -> 622862  (3.5% off)
    N = 10^6 -> 7474338 (0.1% off)

This is called near-linear growth. The value we've got is close to the
theoretical Â½ N lg N.
