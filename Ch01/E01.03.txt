Describe a simple method for counting the number of sets remaining after
using the union and find operations to solve the connectivity problem as
described in the text.

The process starts with as many sets as there are elements. Call it T.
Each time a union occurs, the number of set decreases by 1. Let's call
U to the total number of unions performed.
The number of sets remaining after the process ends is S = T - U.
