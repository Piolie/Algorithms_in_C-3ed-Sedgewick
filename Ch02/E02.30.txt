------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are given the information that the running time of one algorithm is
always about N log N and that the running time of another algorithm is
always about N^3. What does this statement imply about the relative
performance of the algorithms?
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

It implies that the first algorithm always performs much better than the
second.
