------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are given the information that the time complexity of one problem is
N log N and that the time complexity of another problem is N^3. What
does this statement imply about the relative performance of specific
algorithms that solve the problems?

The book states:
    The field of computational complexity is the branch of analysis of
    algorithms that helps us to understand the fundamental limitations
    that we can expect to encounter when designing algorithms. The
    overall goal is to determine the worst-case running time of the best
    algorithm to solve a given problem, to within a constant factor.
    This function is called the complexity of the problem.

    When we can prove that the worst-case running time of an algorithm
    to solve a certain problem is O(f(N)), we say that f(N) is an upper
    bound on the complexity of the problem. In other words, the running
    time of the best algorithm to solve a problem is no higher than the
    running time of any particular algorithm to solve the problem.

For the first problem, no algorithm that solves it will have a better
worst-case running time than N log N.

For the second problem, no algorithm that solves it will have a better
worst-case running time than N^3.

Not necessarily a specific algorithm that solves the first problem will
have a better worst-case running time than a specific algorithm that
solves the second.

It could very well be the case that a specific algorithm for the first
problem has worst-case running time of N^5, while a specific algorithm
for the second problem has a worst-case running time of N^3.
