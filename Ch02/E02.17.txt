Give a simple expression for floor[lg F_N].

The Fibonacci numbers can be calculated as:
    F_N = [f]
where
    f = phi^5/sqrt 5
and [ ] denotes rounding to the closest integer.

Suppose f lies between the integers k and k+1. There are three
possibilities:

1) f is closer to k, that is k < f < k + 1/2
   ----- k ----- f ----- k+1/2 ----- f+1/2 ----- k+1 -----
This implies that
    k < f + 1/2 < k + 1
so
    F_N = [f] = k = floor[f + 1/2]

2) f is closer to k+1, that is k + 1/2 < f < k + 1
   ----- k ---------- k+1/2 ----- f ----- k+1 ----- f+1/2
This implies that
    k + 1 < f + 1/2 < k + 2
so
    F_N = [f] = k + 1 = floor[f + 1/2]

3) f is lies exactly in the middle, that is f  = k + 1/2
   ----- k --------------- f --------------- k+1 -----
I'm not sure this is even possible. There are many rounding strategies
for dealing with cases like these. All arbitrary. See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_to_the_nearest_integer

Ignoring this anomalous case, we can see that a simple expression for
F_N is:
    F_N = floor[phi^5/sqrt 5 + 1/2]
