------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the family of recurrences like Formula 2.1, where we allow
N/2 to be interpreted as floor[N/2] or ceil[N/2], and we require only
that the recurrence hold for N > c_0 with C_N = O(1) for N <= c_0. Prove
that lg N + O(1) is the solution to all such recurrences.
