Prove that O(1) is the same as O(2).

    Definition 2.1 A function g(N) is said to be O(f(N)) if there exist
    constants c_0 and N_0 such that g(N) < c_0 f(N), for all N > N_0.

Thus, a function g(N) is O(1) if there exist constants c_0 and N_0 such
that g(N) < c_0 * 1, for all N > N_0.

The inequality also implies that:
    g(N) < 2c_0 * 1 = c_0 * 2, for all N > N_0
which is the definition of g(N) being O(2).
