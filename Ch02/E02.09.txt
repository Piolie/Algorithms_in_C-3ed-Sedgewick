Prove that ceil[lg N] is the number of bits required to represent N in
binary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Let's suppose N requires n bits for its binary representation. Then:
    N = b_0 * 2^0 + b_1 * 2^1 + ... + b_(n-2) * 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-1)

This means that:
    2^(n-1) <= N < 2^n
applying lg to all: (remember lg 2^i = i)
    n-1 <= lg N < n
since n is an integer, it means that:
    n = ceil[lg N]
