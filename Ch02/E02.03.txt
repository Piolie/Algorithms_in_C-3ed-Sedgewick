                              EXERCISE 2.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Develop an expression of the form
    c_0 + c_1 * N + c_2 * N^2 + c_3 * N^3
that accurately describes the running time of your program from
Exercise 2.2. Compare the times predicted by this expression with actual
times, for N = 10, 100, and 1000.

The solution is easy to set up. For each N, we have a corresponding
running time from exercise 2.1:
    T = c_0 + c_1 * N + c_2 * N^2 + c_3 * N^3

Since the expression has 4 unknowns (c_0, c_1, c_2 and c_3), we need to
run the the program with 4 different values of N. With these we can
write a 4x4 linear system of equations:

    T1 = c_0 + c_1 * N1 + c_2 * N1^2 + c_3 * N1^3
    T2 = c_0 + c_1 * N2 + c_2 * N2^2 + c_3 * N2^3
    T3 = c_0 + c_1 * N3 + c_2 * N3^2 + c_3 * N3^3
    T4 = c_0 + c_1 * N4 + c_2 * N4^2 + c_3 * N4^3

and solve for c_0, c_1, c_2 and c_3. (I won't do it.)

Another approach would be making many runs for many more different
values of N, and then using some curve fitting procedure
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting) to determine the
parameters that better fit the data.
