------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain how you would sort a deck of cards with the restriction that the
cards must be kept stacked in the deck, and the only allowed operations
are to look at the value of the top two cards, to exchange the top two
cards, and to move the top card to the bottom of the deck.
