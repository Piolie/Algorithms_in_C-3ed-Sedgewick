                              EXERCISE 6.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A card trick requires that you put a deck of cards in order by suit (in
the order spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds) and by rank within each suit.
Ask a few friends to do this task (shuffling in between!) and write down
the method(s) that they use.

No friend volunteered. (Totally unrelated to my lack of friends.)
