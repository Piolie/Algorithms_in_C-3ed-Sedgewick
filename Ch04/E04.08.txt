Given two sequences, give an algorithm for determining whether or not
asterisks can be added to make the first produce the second, when
interpreted as a sequence of stack operations in the sense of
Exercise 4.7.

I'll assume that all elements are unique and that sequence 2 is a
permutation of sequence 1.

do {
  push next element in sequence 1;
  if (top element == next element in sequence 2)
    pop it;
} until sequence 1 is exhausted

if stack is empty => it can be done
