Definition 4.1
- An abstract data type (ADT) is a data type (a set of values and a
collection of operations on those values) that is accessed only through
an interface. We refer to a program that uses an ADT as a client, and a
program that specifies the data type as an implementation.

Definition 4.2
- A pushdown stack is an ADT that comprises two basic operations: insert
(push) a new item, and delete (pop) the item that was most recently
inserted.

Definition 4.3
- A FIFO queue is an ADT that comprises two basic operations: insert
(put) a new item, and delete (get) the item that was least recently
inserted.

Definition 4.4
- A first-class data type is one for which we can have potentially many
different instances, and which we can assign to variables which we can
declare to hold the instances.
