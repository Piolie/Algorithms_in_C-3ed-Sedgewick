                             EXERCISE 4.78
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a client program that uses your polynomial ADT from Exercise 4.75
to evaluate integrals by using Taylor series approximations of
functions, manipulating them symbolically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Accomplishing this requires that we know (or can compute) values of the
function of interest and of some of its derivatives around a certain
point. Once we have that, we can construct its Taylor series
approximation and integrate the series to calculate the integal.
For the last part, the functions provided by the polynomial ADT are
enough.
