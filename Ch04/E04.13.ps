% Write a PostScript program that draws this figure:
%                                                        ____
%                                                       |    |
%                                                   ____|    |____

%   Figure 4.3
%   Sample PostScript program
%   The diagram at the top was drawn by the PostScript program below it.
%
%   The program is a postfix expression that uses the built-in functions
%   moveto, rlineto, rotate, stroke and dup; and the userÂ­defined
%   function hill (see text). The graphics commands are instructions to
%   a plotting device: moveto instructs that device to go to the
%   specified position on the page (coordinates are in points, which are
%   1/72 inch); rlineto instructs it to move to the specified position
%   in coordinates relative to its current position, adding the line it
%   makes to its current path; rotate instructs it to turn left the
%   specified number of degrees; and stroke instructs it to draw the
%   path that it has traced.
%
%       /\
%   ___/  \___
%            /\
%           /  \
%          /    \
%   ______/      \______
%
%   /hill {
%     dup 0 rlineto
%     60 rotate
%     dup 0 rlineto
%     -120 rotate
%     dup 0 rlineto
%     60 rotate
%     dup 0 rlineto
%     pop
%   } def
%   0 0 moveto
%   144 hill
%   0 72 moveto
%   72 hill
%   stroke
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% I'm using the MikTeX-provided ps2pdf command line tool to render the
% postscript and be able to visualize the result. I've noticed that the
% code from figure 4.3 above doesn't render as shown in the book, but
% more like:
%
%      /\   /\
%  ___/  \_/_ \
%         /    \
%  ______/      \______
%
%  I could more accurately reproduce it by changing the last moveto to:
%    0 144 moveto
%  Was it an bug in the program or my rendering stack? Who cares!.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%  My code for the exercise is: (you can check the output at E04.13.pdf)

<< /PageSize [450 150] >> setpagedevice
/square {
  dup 0 rlineto
  90 rotate
  dup 0 rlineto
  -90 rotate
  dup 0 rlineto
  -90 rotate
  dup 0 rlineto
  90 rotate
  dup 0 rlineto
  pop
} def
0 0 moveto
150 square
stroke
